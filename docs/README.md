# MERN Stack Application

## Packages

The application built on the MERN stack.

The client part of the application is built on:

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used to build the components of the application.

- **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)**: A collection of navigational components that used for routing in the application.

- **[React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)**: A library that provides popular icons.

- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It's used for building the application and for local development.

- **[Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)**: A set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This project uses `@testing-library/react` for React component testing, `@testing-library/user-event` for simulating user events, and `@testing-library/jest-dom` for custom jest matchers.

- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework. It's used to style the application.

- **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)** used to compile the application.

- **[Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)**: A tool to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules. It's used to ensure the application's CSS works on all browsers.

- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. In this project, TypeScript is used to improve code quality and developer productivity. It adds static typing, which helps catch errors at compile time rather than at runtime. The project is configured to use TypeScript with ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. The TypeScript configuration is defined in the `tsconfig.json`.
